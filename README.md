# SerenityEscapesUpdatedVersion

Serenity Escapes is a website for a travel agency. The main page is `index.html`. That is were you'll find my custom JavaScript, the slideshow at the bottom (the code is in `scripts.js`), and most of my Bootstrap and custom CSS (located in `styles.css`). The other pages are there to fill out the rest of the website.

To load the project just open `index.html` in a browser.
